*************************************   CASSANDRA IMPORTANT NOTES  *************************************************************

What is Apache Cassandra?

Fast Distributed Database, HA, Linear Scalability, Predictable Performance, No SPOF, Multi-DC, Commodity Hardware, Easy to manage operationally, Not a drop in replacement for RDBMS

## Hash Ring
+ No master / slave / replica sets
+ No config servers, zookeeper
+ Data is partitioned around the ring
+ Data is replicated to RF=N servers
+ All node hold data and can answer queries (both reads & writes)
+ Location of data on ring is determined by partition key

## CAP Tradeoffs
+ Impossible to be both consistent and highly available during a network partition
+ Latency between data centers also makes consistency impractical
+ Cassandra chooses Availability & Partition Tolerance over Consistency

## Replication
+ Data is replicated automatically
+ You pick number of servers
+ Called "replication factor" or RF
+ Data is ALWAYS replicated to each replica
+ If a machine is down, missing data is replayed via hinted handoff

## Consistency Levels
+ Per query consistency
+ ALL, QUORUM, ONE
+ How many replicas for query to respond OK

## Multi DC
+ Typical usage: clients write to local DC, replcated async to other DCs
+ Replication factor per keyspace per datacenter
+ Datacenters can be physical or logical
